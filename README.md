# selfmade-react-dropzone

Simple React hook to create a HTML5-compliant drag'n'drop zone for files with support for appending files through multiple drag and drop. This is based on https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone/

## Installation

Install it from npm and include it in your React build process (using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), etc).

```bash
npm install --save selfmade-react-dropzone
```
or:
```bash
yarn add selfmade-react-dropzone
```

## Usage

Please refer to https://react-dropzone.js.org for documentation and examples. The only difference this package offers is the `appendFiles` option which is set to true by default.
